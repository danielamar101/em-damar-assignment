This shouldn’t take more than 3 hours. If you are stuck or spending more time than that on this please don’t hesitate to let me know. We want to be respectful of your time.
Elliott is a security first environment. Please consider the security implications of your decisions.
Please feel free to do this in the language you are most comfortable with.
 

Challenge:

The Chief Information Security Officer wants to know that our external websites are properly secured and are functional for our clients. Please write a program, in a language of your chose, to do the following:

 

Retrieve up to date SSL scan results for www.elliottmgmt.com from Qualys SSL Labs API documentation is available at (https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/stable/ssllabs-api-docs.md)
Format relevant information into a report ready for email distribution.
 

Once you have completed your program, please create a Dockerfile so we can deploy and run it.

 

Assuming you have coded this challenge, now answer the following questions in a few sentences within the readme:

How would you scale this script and run it with resiliency to e.g. handle 1000s of domains?
How would you monitor/alert on this service?
What would you do to handle adding new domains to scan or certificate expiry events from your service?
After some time, your report requires more enhancements requested by the Tech team of the company. How would you handle these "continuous" requirement changes in a sustainable manner?
 

You can submit this through a public git repo that we can clone.

 

I look forward to seeing what you can do!
